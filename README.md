## 🕉️ About Damodarāṣṭakam

The Damodarāṣṭakam is a sacred prayer glorifying Lord Krishna in His Damodara form (with a rope around His waist). This eight-verse prayer is traditionally recited during the month of Kartika and is known for its ability to attract Lord Damodara's mercy.

> "In the month of Kartika one should worship Lord Damodara and daily recite the prayer known as Damodarashtaka, which has been spoken by the sage Satyavrata and which attracts Lord Damodara." - Sri Hari-bhakti-vilasa 2.16.198
