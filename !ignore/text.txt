STRONG MEN
A cinematic scene featuring a very muscular man — a bodybuilder with huge, well-defined muscles. His expression is confident but slightly clueless, showing that he’s strong but not very intellectual. Looking at the camera, he says proudly: “I usually sing the Damodarāṣṭakam straight from the heart — I don’t even need the translation.”
The tone is carrying sincerity. The style is photorealistic, cinematic lighting, detailed textures of skin and muscles, shallow depth of field focused on his face and upper body. 
 

ANGELS
A cinematic heavenly scene — two radiant angels (without wings) sitting on soft, glowing clouds high in the sky. Warm golden light surrounds them. Both angels look friendly and expressive. One angel joyfully holds an iPhone 15 Pro, showing the screen to the other, and says with excitement: “Finally, I found the best app for Damodarāṣṭakam!”
Then, the second angel turns toward the camera. The camera smoothly refocuses on him as he leans closer to the lens, speaking directly to the viewer: “What, did you think we don’t have Kartika here in heaven?”
The tone is as a normal live in heaven, very natural. The style is photorealistic with cinematic lighting, dynamic camera focus, and subtle movement in the clouds.

GRANDMOTHERS
Two elderly Russian grandmothers sitting together on an old wooden bench in a typical rural courtyard. The surroundings show the modest reality of village life — worn-out houses, a dirt yard, a cat sitting nearby, a dog wandering around, and a cow grazing in the background, with a few metal buckets nearby. There are no chickens in the scene. The atmosphere feels simple, raw, and authentic, with slightly grey, overcast light. The first grandmother is short, plump, with rosy cheeks, wearing a faded floral scarf and a thick knitted sweater; she holds an iPhone 15 Pro, showing the screen to the other. The second grandmother is tall and thin, with sharp features and kind eyes, dressed very positive and funny; she leans closer, curious but cautious, showing a mix of warmth and sternness. The mood is touching — a mix of hardship and genuine connection. Photorealistic style, cinematic realism, natural muted colors, slightly gritty texture. The grandmother which is holding the phone says in Russian: "Смотри, что я скачала [pause for 1 secund а потом следущее слево говорит с акцентом] Дамодара аштаку !! After pause for 2 seconds another grandmothers says: Пойдем петь! Этот Кришна такой классный." Очень естественный обмен эмоциями.
